# User Authentication API

This project is a robust user authentication API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides secure endpoints for user registration, login, logout, and profile updates.

## Key Features:
- User registration with password hashing
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure login and logout functionality
- Profile update capabilities
- MongoDB integration for data persistence

## Tech Stack:
- Node.js & Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose ORM
- bcrypt for password hashing
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- dotenv for environment variable management
- cors for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

This API serves as a solid foundation for applications requiring user management and authentication. It implements best practices for security, including password hashing and JWT token management. The codebase is structured for scalability and easy maintenance, making it suitable for both small projects and larger applications.

To get started, clone the repository, install dependencies, set up your MongoDB connection, and run the server. Detailed setup instructions can be found in the project documentation.
